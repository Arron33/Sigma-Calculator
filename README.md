# Sigma-Calculator
 C++ program to take input geological data, perform data manipulation and calculations in order to output the principal stress orientations of geological structures.

This program was developed as part of my advanced programing module. The application allows a user to enter new dip and dip direction data or read in from a file. It then calculates the maximum principal stress component that formed the geological structure defined by the dip measurments.
